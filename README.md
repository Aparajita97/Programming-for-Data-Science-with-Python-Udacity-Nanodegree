This repository contains projects did for Udacity Programming For Data Science With Python Nanodegree.



## Project 1 : Investigate a Relational Database

### <em>Overview:

This project required the student to explore a database of available movie rentals, execute SQL queries against it, and create visualizations to display the results of their queries. 

The student had to make four slides for the presentation portion, and each slide had to feature
 
 * Movie categories that are being watched
 * Number of rental orders for each store per month
 * Top 10 paying customers
 * Running total amount paid on film rental on each month


## Project 2 : Explore US Bikeshare Data

### <em>Overview:
You will use Python in this project to investigate data pertaining to bike share programs in three significant American cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will create the code to import the data and use descriptive statistics to answer intriguing questions about it. To provide these statistics interactively in the terminal, you will also construct a script that accepts raw input.

The created CLI software enables the user to search a database for the US bikeshare system and extract statistics data from the database. In order to display statistics information linked to a certain subset of data, the user can filter the information by city, month, and weekday. 

## Project 3 : Post your Work on GitHub

### <em>Overview:

This project involved refactoring Project 2 utilizing Git, GitHub, and a simulated workflow.

The Project Submission was a template that was filled up with all the Git commands necessary to complete the desired tasks.
